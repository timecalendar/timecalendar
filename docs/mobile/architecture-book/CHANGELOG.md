# Architecture Book changelog

## 2026-08-08

- Aligned the notifications feature to the server's v2 wire contract: lowercase
  `new | edit | cancel` payload canon plus the `calendar_digest` action (routes to
  Calendar, re-syncs on foreground), and the subscription DTO now carries `locale`/
  `timezone` read through effective accessors, with language- and timezone-change
  re-registration triggers (ADRs 027/028, firebase.md).

## 2026-08-07

- Established Home · Calendar · Settings as the mobile tab hierarchy, with a nested
  Settings Stack, feature-owned grouped destination hub, derived held-calendar
  summary, and temporary `/profile` compatibility redirect (ADR 034).
